# Professional Portfolio

This is a professional portfolio website built using React to showcase my skills, projects, and experience to potential employers and clients, following om from my knowledge and experience in a Coding Bootcamp. I will continue to add projects to my github projects to show development of my skills to realworld projects. 

## Features

- Responsive design: The website is optimized for various screen sizes and devices.
- Navigation: Users can easily navigate through different sections of the portfolio.
- About Me: Provides a brief introduction about myself, highlighting my background and expertise.
- Skills: Showcases the skills I have acquired, including programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
- Projects: Displays a collection of my past projects with descriptions, images, and links to repositories.
- Contact: Offers a convenient way for visitors to get in touch with me via email or social media platforms.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
